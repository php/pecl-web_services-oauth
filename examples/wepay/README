WePay is a group payment service which makes managing money for groups simple.

These example scripts come with a test consumer key and secret which you can
use to test the API, but they may be rate limited or disabled entirely at any
point, so you should go to https://www.wepay.com/developer/register to register
your own consumer key and shared secret which you can put in the config.inc.php
file.

Once you have your own consumer key and secret, run the request_token.php script.
This script returns what is known as an unauthorized request token.  In order to
authorize it, you will need to visit the URL the request_token.php script 
returns.  Once you have visited this URL you will be redirected to a page on
http://progphp.com.  This is just a stub callback page that acts as a placeholder
in order for these example scripts to work.  When you build you own oauth 
consumer you will be writing your own callback endpoint which WePay will redirect
users to.  This callback URL is configured on WePay's /developer/register page on
a per-app basis.

Next, run the access_token.php script.  This script will fetch the verifier from
the progphp.com stuf callback endpoint and contact WePay to exchange the
authorized request token for an access token.

This access token will now allow your application to access the API on behalf
of the user who athoried it.  Run the balances.php script to see an example of
calling the API.
